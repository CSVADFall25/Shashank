Drawing - Dance

Philosophy behind the design: 

Why only dance should be the response to music. What if we approach the way we vibe through drawing or sketches. 

SImilar to Jason Polock's approach to paint while listening to Jazz. 

I get a lot of dance moves in my mind and forget them like a dream after a while. So what if I had a tool to record them through a different language that can be eventually used to choreograph different dance forms. (Which is the idea I have for the final project)

Built Process: How and What is happening ?

The user uploads music or soundtrack they like. The tool analyses the track based on main components like tune, rhythm, number beats. (The way the factors extrtcated from the music effects the drawing has to be re-thought. Now it is pretty abstract. )

Constraint?: 
The constraint here is, you can only draw when there is a beat. The idea to to apply more constraints which takes the drawing performance more closer to the drawing.
canvas physics: Plan on changing the way the canvas behaves 

I want to reduce abstractness and semi-finished creation(a semi sketch) as a part of elements used to make the drawing. 

The instructions to use the controller with the tool is mentioned on the tool page next to the canvas. 




* Tips: If the tool crashes, please referesh the page.
*Connect your controller for full functionality.
